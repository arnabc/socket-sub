h1. PubSubHubbub Web Socket Subscriber

bq. Caveat Emptor: This project is still under development and is not yet even at alpha quality. That said, all contributions and feedback are welcome.

h2. Install and dependencies

This needs to happen on a server that is NOT behind a firewall. PubSubHubbub is a server-to-server protocol. It won't work on your local machine. You can certainly try to use the wonderful "Localtunnel":http://github.com/progrium/localtunnel/ from "@progrium":http://twitter.com/progrium, the wizard.

# Install "Node.js":http://nodejs.org/

# Install "ExpressJS":http://expressjs.com/guide.html

# Clone repository : @git clone git://github.com/julien51/socket-sub.git@

# Add the node-websocket-server submodule : @git submodule init@ and @git submodule update@

h2. Configure

# @cp default_config.json config.json@

# Edit the @config.json@ file (Feel free to setup the @debug@ flag to true if something is weird)

h2. Run it

# @$ node server.js@

# Edit the @client.html@ file 

# Open in it your favorite browser (even from your local filesystem, the magic happens thru websockets). Ha, yes you *need a browser that supports WebSockets*.



Have fun!
